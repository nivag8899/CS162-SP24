# CS162: Operating Systems - Notes & Learnings / 操作系统 - 旁听笔记与学习

## Overview / 简介

During my exchange program at Berkeley, I was unable to enroll in CS162 (Operating Systems). However, after returning to China, I decided to audit the course. The content was extremely well-organized, and I found it to be highly beneficial, especially in the areas of synchronization, scheduling, memory management, and file systems. This course offered more comprehensive insights compared to the course offered at my home university.

在伯克利访学期间，我未能选上CS162（操作系统）。然而，回国后，我决定旁听这门课程。课程内容非常有条理，尤其在同步、调度、内存管理和文件系统等方面的讲解让我受益匪浅。这门课程的内容比我本校的操作系统课程要全面得多。

## Topics Covered / 讲解的主要内容

- **Synchronization / 同步**  
  Introduction to concurrency, critical sections, locks, semaphores, and advanced synchronization techniques.

- **Scheduling / 调度**  
  Study of process scheduling algorithms, including FIFO, Round Robin, and priority scheduling.

- **Memory Management / 内存管理**  
  Detailed discussions on memory allocation, paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.

- **File Systems / 文件系统**  
  Concepts related to file system architecture, file management, and storage techniques.

- **Distributed / 分布式**
  Some basic concepts on distributed systems.
