# CS162-SP24

## Overview

During my exchange program at Berkeley, I was unable to enroll in CS162 (Operating Systems). However, after returning to China, I decided to audit the course. The content was extremely well-organized, and I found it to be highly beneficial. This course offered more comprehensive insights compared to the course offered at my home university.
